# Exercise 2: Login page for MVC web application

In this exercise we are going to add an login page to our identity server. This is used to authenticate users for our web MVC application. To solve this we are going to use OpenID Connect Implicit flow. 

## Exercise 2.1: Add an UI to identity server

First we need to add a working UI for our identity server. Fortunately for us, the creators of IdentityServer4 have a very good MVC quickstart setup we can use to get started. This is not an production ready UI, it is primarly for demo purposes and to act as an template when building your real solution.

The repo for the quickstart is located here: https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI#adding-the-quickstart-ui

Follow the instructions in the link or follow the steps provided here (very similar):

### Step 1

Open an powershell terminal and navigate to the root of the IdentityServer project. Use the following command:

```Powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI/master/getmaster.ps1'))
```

Or using bash one-liner on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI/master/getmaster.sh | bash
```

### Step 2 

Ensure that  MVC is added to your identity server and configure the pipeline:
```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();

    // Identity server configuration
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); 
    }

    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseIdentityServer();

    app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute();
}
```

### Step 3

To verify that we have an UI, compile and start your identity server and navigate to: http://localhost:5000

## Exercise 2.2: Add Implict flow login for MVC web  

With the UI in place we can now add an OpenId Implict flow client configuration in our identity server for the MVC web.

### Step 1

Now we need to add a new client in the identity server. This client will contain more configuration, most important how to navigate between the identity server and the MVC web.

```C#
new Client
{
    ClientId = "mvcweb",
    ClientName = "MVC web",
    AllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.Implicit,

    // where to redirect to after login
    RedirectUris = {"http://localhost:5002/signin-oidc"},

    // where to redirect to after logout
    PostLogoutRedirectUris = {"http://localhost:5002/signout-callback-oidc"},

    AllowedScopes = new List<string>
    {
        IdentityServerConstants.StandardScopes.OpenId,
        IdentityServerConstants.StandardScopes.Profile,
    }
}
```

### Step 2

In exercise 1 we used the ApiResources concept that uses scopes to define an application. Now when have an user with an identity instead of a defined Api. OpenID Connect uses scopes to define identity data. We are going to add the two standard OpenId Connect scopes, which are defined in the OpenId Connect specification.

```C#
services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddDeveloperSigningCredential()
        ....
        .AddInMemoryIdentityResources(new List<IdentityResource>
                            {
                                new IdentityResources.OpenId(),
                                new IdentityResources.Profile(),
                            }) 
```

### Step 3

Next we introduce the concept of users. For demo and development purposes IdentityServer has the concept of TestUser. We are going to use TestUsers in this workshop, so we add two users: 

```C#
services.AddIdentityServer()
        .AddDeveloperSigningCredential()
        ....
        .AddTestUsers(new List<TestUser>
            {
                new TestUser
                {
                    SubjectId = "1",
                    Username = "user1",
                    Password = "password",

                    Claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim("name", "User1"),
                        new Claim("website", "http://www.eventstore.org"),
                    }
                },
                new TestUser
                {
                    SubjectId = "2",
                    Username = "user2",
                    Password = "password",

                    Claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim("name", "User2"),
                        new Claim("website", "http://www.eventstore.org"),
                    }
                }
            });
```

TestUsers should not be used in production. If you want user control, you should replace the TestUserStore in the AccountController with your own implementation. There is an tutorial in the IdentityServer4 docs if you want to use ASP.NET Identity: https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/6_aspnet_identity.html

### Step 4

Now we are going to configure the MVC web to use OpenID Connect. First we going to "fix" Microsoft's OpenIdConnect handler. More info here:
https://leastprivilege.com/2017/11/15/missing-claims-in-the-asp-net-core-2-openid-connect-handler/

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
    
    ....
```

Then we add the configuration for OpenId Connect:

```C#
services.AddAuthentication(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultScheme = "Cookies";
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = "oidc";
    })
    .AddCookie("Cookies")
    .AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
    {
        options.SignInScheme = "Cookies";
            
        options.Authority = "http://localhost:5000";
        options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;

        options.ClientId = "mvcweb";
        options.SaveTokens = true;
    });
```

We also need to add authentication in the pipeline:
```C#
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseAuthentication();

app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute();
```

What happens here is that we set the DefaultScheme to be `Cookies`, which is configured with the standard ASP.NET Auth Cookies scheme `.AddCookie("Cookies")`. Then we set the ChallengeScheme to `oidc`. 
* If an user request an MVC route with an `[Authorize]` attribute and the user has an valid cookie for scheme `Cookies`, then the user is authenticated and is allowed access
* If an user request an MVC route with an `[Authorize]` attribute and the user unauthenticated, then we challenge the request with the scheme `oidc`. This results in that the user is redirected to the authorize endpoint on the Authority site (our IdentityServer). When user comes back and the id_token is verified, then user is signed in to the authentication scheme `Cookies`.

### Step 5

No we can test the login page by adding a `[Authorize]` attribute in the `HomeController` to the `Secure()` method and start both the MVC web and the identity server.
If we go to http://localhost:5002/home/secure, we should now be redirect to the login page. Signin with one of the TestUsers. If the signin was successfull you should now se a consent page. Here can the user select how much information he/her wish to grant to the site. 

It is also possible to turn off consent on the client configuration:
```C#
RequireConsent = false,
```

### Step 6

If you tried to click the logout button in the MVC web, you might have noticed that it does not work. We have to add an logout action in the `HomeController` to handle logout for both the mvc web and the identity server.

```C#
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync("Cookies");
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync("oidc");

    // or

    return SignOut("Cookies", "oidc");
}
```

Here we signout of Auth Cookie scheme and the triggers the signout on the OpenId Connect Handler. This will redirect the browser so that the user signs out of the identity server aswell.

## Recap

We now have a working Implicit flow for our MVC WEB using IdentityServer4. In the next exercise we going to see the Hybrid flow, [here](../03-BackendApiAccess-HybridFlow)
